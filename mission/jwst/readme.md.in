# {{ info.release_name }}

Conda is required to manage installation of the delivery environment. A fresh installation of {{ conda.installer_name }} is not required for each {{ meta.name }} delivery, however. An existing conda installation may be used. The method described here allows for multiple entirely separate pipeline installations.

A POSIX-compatible shell (e.g. `bash`) is required for all steps below. Python dependencies are taken directly from PyPI or development repositories as needed, so conda's ability to install hybrid conda/pip environments from a YAML specification is used. This requires first downloading the specification file and then creating the environment with it.

# Installing Conda

If conda is not available on the target system, it will need to be installed and configured before the delivery environment can be installed.

For detailed instructions of this step, please visit:
https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html

**{{ conda.installer_name }}:**

```
wget {{ conda.installer_baseurl }}/{{ conda.installer_name }}-{{ conda.installer_version }}-{{ conda.installer_platform }}-{{ conda.installer_arch }}.sh
bash {{ conda.installer_name }}-{{ conda.installer_version }}-{{ conda.installer_platform }}-{{ conda.installer_arch }}.sh
$HOME/{{ conda.installer_name }}/condabin/conda init
```

# Installing {{ meta.name }}

## Option 1: Install this delivery

```
conda env create \
    --file https://ssb.stsci.edu/stasis/releases/{{ meta.mission }}/{{ info.build_name }}/delivery/{{ info.release_name }}.yml
```

### Activate this delivery

```
conda activate {{ info.release_name }}
```

## Option 2: Install the latest delivery

**Warning:** The `latest` URL may provide software different than what is presented by the release notes section below!

```
conda env create \
    --name {{ meta.name }}-latest-py{{ meta.python_compact }} \
    --file https://ssb.stsci.edu/stasis/releases/{{ meta.mission }}/{{ info.build_name }}/delivery/latest-py{{ meta.python_compact }}-{{ system.platform }}-{{ system.arch }}.yml
```
### Activate the latest delivery

```
conda activate {{ meta.name }}-latest-py{{ meta.python_compact }}
```

------

Each new delivery iteration will need to be installed using one of the above commands.
